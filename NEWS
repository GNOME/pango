Overview of changes between 1.2.x and 1.3.0
===========================================
* Share modules between the FT2 and Xft backend. Export PangoFcFont
  and PangoFcFontMap base classes so that other fontconfig based
  backends can be written and use these same modules.
* Redo module system to use GTypeModule and work much like GTK+ theme
  engines and input method modules.
* Change modules to declare coverage by script, rather than by code
  point. Add a ->covers callback so that modules can dynamically
  decide whether they can cover a particular codepoint with a given
  font. (This will allow multiple modules to handle a script for
  different types fonts.)
* Complete rewrite of itemization pass. Now uses script information to
  improve language tags. This solves problems with incorrect language
  tags resulting in drastically wrong fonts being selected by
  fontconfig.

  deletion behavior for non-Western scripts.  [Noah Levitt]

  binary compatibility.

  saving to different file formats, etc.

  improvements. [James Henstridge]
