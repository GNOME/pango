	Bug 549758 – Swedish font sample text could use punctuation
	Bug 549522 – New pt_BR pangram for pango
	Bug 549520 – fr sample string

Overview of changes between 1.21.4 and 1.21.5
=============================================
- Make the reference the font->fontmap reference weak.  Previously all
  fontmaps had circular references to their fonts and back, making them
  leak instead of being freed upon finalization.  Now they all clean after
  themselves.  There's a slight semantic change though, that a PangoFont does
  not keep its fontmap alive anymore, so that's up to the user.  But then
  again, finalizing fontmaps is not a good idea to begin with.

- Improve pango_language_get_sample_string() to add language sample texts that
  are actually usable.  Compiled from a variety of sources.
  See pango-language-sample-table.h.

- In pango_language_get_sample_string() use default language if provided
  language is NULL.

- Update OpenType language-system tags to OpenType 1.5 draft intersected with
  ISO639-3 of 2008/08/04.

- New API additions:
	Add a minor new public API:

		pango_language_get_scripts()
	
	This is what pango_language_includes_script() has been using
	internally.  Previously one had to call that function over all
	possible script values to determine which scripts a language
	uses.  The new API makes that much easier.

- Bugs fixed in this release:
	Bug 549003 – pango_layout_set_height(): layout should not be cleared
		     unless required
	Bug 143542 – PangoFT2Fontmap leak
	Bug 314094 – Get rid of poutpourri default sample string
	Bug 473806 – Improve pango_language_get_sample_string()
	Bug 473805 – Add API enumerating scripts for a language
	Bug 470895 – Improve OpenType language tag list
	Bug 547432 – Deprecation of pango_(backend)_font_map_create_context()
		     not clean

Overview of changes between 1.21.3 and 1.21.4
=============================================
- Use cairo_show_text_glyphs() if target cairo surface supports that.
  This is done by adding a new PangoRenderer method, draw_glyph_item().
  Custom PangoRenderer implementations that delegate to pango_cairo
  may want to implement this method if they target PDF files.
- Requires cairo >= 1.7.4 now
- Win32 build improvements
- Justify lines broken by U+2028 LINE SEPARATOR
- Various small fixes and improvements
- New API additions:

	New public API:

		PangoRenderer::draw_glyph_item()
		pango_renderer_draw_glyph_item()

	Make layout and layout-line default renderers go through
	draw_glyph_item(), which then by default falls back to
	draw_glyphs().  The advantage in draw_glyph_item() is that it
	has access to the text and cluster information.

	New public API, for iterating a PangoGlyphItem:

		PangoGlyphItemIter
		PANGO_TYPE_GLYPH_ITEM_ITER
		pango_glyph_item_iter_copy()
		pango_glyph_item_iter_free()
		pango_glyph_item_iter_init_start()
		pango_glyph_item_iter_init_end()
		pango_glyph_item_iter_next_cluster()
		pango_glyph_item_iter_prev_cluster()

	Make the following previously backend-only API public:

		pango_context_new()
		pango_context_set_font_map()

	This also means that bindings are recommended to allow
	instantiation of pango.Context.  This was discouraged before.

	New public API:

		pango_font_map_create_context()

	This is equivalent to pango_context_new() followed by an
	immediate pango_context_set_font_map().  This change also
	deprecates various per-fontmap-type context constructors:

	Deprecate pango_cairo_font_map_create_context().
	Deprecate pango_fc_font_map_create_context().
	Deprecate pango_ft2_font_map_create_context().
	Deprecate pango_win32_get_context().
	Deprecate pango_xft_get_context().
	Deprecate pango_x_get_context().

	Language bindings are encouraged to bind
	pango.Fontmap.create_context() and remove the create_context()
	method from subclass implementations.

- New public API:
	Add new PangoLogAttr member is_word_boundary, that implements UAX#29's
	Word Boundaries semantics.  The is_word_start and is_word_end members
	will change implementation later on to be consitent with the word
	boundaries.

Overview of changes between 1.20.1 and 1.20.2
==============================================
- Really fix build on OS X.

Overview of changes between 1.20.0 and 1.20.1
==============================================
- Update to Unicode Character Databse 5.1.0.  This adds new entries to
  the PangoScript enum.  Requires glib >= 2.16.3 for the update Unicode
  data there, but not bumping the requirement in a stable point release.
- Try making our OS X stuff compile with latest cairo 1.5.x snapshots
  that renamed cairo-atsui to cairo-quartz-font, as well as older versions.
- Minor bug fixes.

Overview of changes between 1.19.4 and 1.20.0
==============================================
- New stable release!
- Bugs fixed in this release:
	Bug 518084 – Thai is not Virama language
		Patch from Theppitak Karoonboonyanan

Overview of changes between 1.19.3 and 1.19.4
==============================================
- Make Win32 backend be able to use Type1 fonts
- Fixed blocker bug with pango_layout_set_height() and positive height.
- Fixed small leak in ATSUI backend.
- Improved docs.
- Bugs fixed in this release:
	Bug 511172 – pango_layout_set_height() with positive height always
		shows at least two lines
	Bug 515484 – Uniscribe interface handles surrogate
		pairs incorrectly

	Bug 512566 – dont' use deprecated macro
		Patch from Christian Persch
	Bug 512473 – [patch] gtk-doc warnings

Overview of changes between 1.19.2 and 1.19.3
==============================================
- pango_layout_get_pixel_extents() and pango_layout_line_get_pixel_extents()
  now round extents to pixels inclusively.  That is, pass both ink_rect and
  logical_rect as first argument to pango_extents_to_pixels().

- Rename pango_extents_to_pixels() function arguments from @ink_rect and
  @logical_rect to @inclusive and @nearest.  Given that this API is a
  fairly new addition and not commonly used, language bindings are
  encouraged to update their argument names accordingly.  Moreover, they
  are encouraged to wrap this function as two different calls:
  extents_to_pixels_inclusive() and extents_to_pixels_nearest(), or
  similar conventions that best reflect their native language.

- HarfBuzz was relicensed to a more generous and simpler license.
  Adapt.  See pango/opentype/COPYING for the new license which is
  LGPL-compatible.

- New public API:

	pango_layout_set_height()

  This sets the height to which the #PangoLayout should be ellipsized at.
  There are two different behaviors, based on whether @height is positive or
  negative.

  If @height is positive, it will be the maximum height of the layout.  Only
  lines would be shown that would fit, and if there is any text ommitted, an
  ellipsis added.  At least one line is included in each paragraph regardless
  of how small the height value is.  A value of zero will render exactly one
  line for the entire layout.

  If @height is negative, it will be the (negative of) maximum number of lines
  per paragraph.  That is, the total number of lines shown may well be more
  than this value if the layout contains multiple paragraphs of text.  The
  default value of -1 means that first line of each paragraph is ellipsized.

  Height setting only has effect if a positive width is set on @layout and
  ellipsization mode of @layout is not %PANGO_ELLIPSIZE_NONE.
  The behavior is undefined if a height other than -1 is set and ellipsization
  mode is set to %PANGO_ELLIPSIZE_NONE, and may change in the future.

  There are still bugs remaining to be fixed, notably bug 511172 (which will
  be fixed before 1.20), and bug 511171 (which will be fixed in a future
  version).

- New command-line arguments to pango-view: --height and --single-par.

- Make the following symbols available to engines:

	PANGO_IS_OT_INFO
	PANGO_IS_OT_RULESET
	PANGO_OT_INFO
	PANGO_OT_RULESET
	PANGO_TYPE_OT_INFO
	PANGO_TYPE_OT_RULESET

Overview of changes between 1.19.1 and 1.19.2
==============================================
- Render a crossed box for each invalid input byte to pango_layout_set_text().
  Previously we rendered an ASCII question mark instead.  The crossed box has
  a glyph of value of PANGO_GLYPH_INVALID_INPUT.
- Use pkg-config to detect cairo features [Benjamin Otte]
- Improved docs.  Particularly, examples/cairo*.c have inline docs now.
- New public macro:

	PANGO_GLYPH_INVALID_INPUT

- Bugs fixed in this release:

	Bug 492517 – Built-in default aliases file
	Bug 495091 – pango-utils.c:variable is declared at middle of block

Overview of changes between 1.18.3 and 1.19.0
==============================================
- Update list of languages to that of fontconfig-2.4.91.
- Various optimizations, making rendering the same Pango layout using
  changing cairo matrices much faster.

- Make sure all boxed type copy/free functions accept NULL as legitimate
  input.  Previously most were g_return_[val_]if_fail()ing it.  This is
  mostly for convenience when writing code in C.

- Apply 'vkrn' GPOS feature in vertical writing.

- In pangofc, set "pangoversion" in pattern passed to fontconfig,
  such that font configuration can condition on being driven by Pango
  or not.

- Various optimizations and cleanups in the OpenType Layout engine,
  aka HarfBuzz.


- Changed APIs:

  * All PangoAttribute constructors are changed to initialize the
    attribute to the range [0..MAXUINT].  The range was undefined
    previously.  All custom attribute constructors are recommended
    to call the new pango_attribute_init() to do the same.

  * Public API chance: Mark the following types as abstract:

	PangoFont
	PangoFontFace
	PangoFontFamily
	PangoFontMap
	PangoFcFont
	PangoFcFontMap

    PangoContext may be marked so in the future too.

  * Make following macros public.  Previously they were only
    defined for backend/engine implementations.

	PANGO_GLYPH_EMPTY
	PANGO_GLYPH_UNKNOWN_FLAG
	PANGO_GET_UNKNOWN_GLYPH()


- New public API:
	
  * Convenience for initializing custom attributes:

	pango_attribute_init()

  * Adding boxed type for PangoGlyphItem:

	PANGO_TYPE_GLYPH_ITEM
	pango_glyph_item_copy()
	pango_glyph_item_get_type()

  * Add missing copy function for a boxed type in C:

	pango_layout_iter_copy()

  * Add missing getter:

	pango_layout_iter_get_layout()

  * Convenience for writing custom PangoRenderer's:

	pango_renderer_get_layout()
	pango_renderer_get_layout_line()

  * PangoFc extensions to fontconfig's pattern syntax:

	PANGO_FC_GRAVITY
	PANGO_FC_VERSION

	Bug 440603 – Minor ABI change

Overview of changes between 1.16.4 and 1.17.0
==============================================

General:

- Text justification.  A simple justification algorithm is implemented
  that tries to justify by expanding spaces in the line, and if none
  found, by adjust letter spacing.  [Based on patch by Mathias
  Hasselmann]

- The pango_script_get_sample_language() function is modified to use
  the value of environment variables PANGO_LANGUAGE or LANGUAGE
  (checked in that order) to make guess better languages for scripts.
  The env var should be a list of language tags, like "en:fa" for
  example where in effect makes Pango choose Persian (fa) fonts
  instead of Arabic (ar) fonts when a run of text in the Arabic script
  is found in an otherwise non-Arabic layout.

  This trick is also useful for East Asian languages.  For example a
  Japanese user that cannot set her primary language to Japanese can
  still set PANGO_LANGUAGE="ja" and Pango will map CJK characters to
  Japanese.

  The LANGUAGE env var is a standard gettext variable listing
  languages the user wants to receive UI translated messages in.
  However, since most packages don't provide separate English
  translations, setting LANGUAGE="en:ja" doesn't have the intended
  effect and UI messages will be shown in Japanese.  For these
  situations one can use LANGUAGE="en:C:ja".  Pango skips the special
  language tag 'C'.

- Simplified embedded-shape rendering with pangocairo backends do.
  [Richard Hult]

- New header file: Moved PangoLanguage APIs into its own header
  pango-language.h, which is included from pango-types.h.

- ATSUI backend now lists synthesized italic faces like other

- Misc optimizations and fixes.

OpenType Layout Engine Improvements:

- Vertical glyph variants are not selected in vertical text if the
  font supports them.

- Instead of hardcoded OpenType script tag in each module, and using
  Default Language System unconditionally, Pango will now find and use
  the script/lang-sys pair that best matches the detected script and
  language of a run of text.  Moreover, it also applies the OpenType
  'locl' feature.
  
  These, plus the PANGO_LANGUAGE env var, give font designers and
  users lots of options to provide/choose language-specific glyph
  variants.
  
  Only basic, arabic, and syriac modules updated to take advantage of
  the new support so far.

New pango-view command line options:

	--align
	--justify
	--language

Public API Changes:

- New public pangocairo API:

	PangoCairoShapeRendererFunc
	pango_cairo_context_set_shape_renderer() 
	pango_cairo_context_get_shape_renderer() 

  These are used by the default pangocairo renderer to render shape
  attributes (see examples/cairoshape.c).  Cairo-based PangoRenderer
  implementations outside Pango may want to implement the draw_shape()
  method similarly to provide compatibility with these new APIs.  (See
  bug #437533 for GdkPangoRenderer for example.)

- Other public API changes:

	New is_expandable_space member in PangoLogAttr
	New macro PANGO_UNITS_ROUND()

- New OpenType engine API.  These are engine API, for use by Pango
  modules, and typically need not to be bound by language bindings:

	PANGO_OT_NO_FEATURE
	PANGO_OT_NO_SCRIPT
	PANGO_OT_TAG_DEFAULT_SCRIPT
	PANGO_OT_TAG_DEFAULT_LANGUAGE
	PangoOTFeatureMap
	PangoOTRulesetDescription
	pango_ot_ruleset_get_for()
	pango_ot_ruleset_new_for()
	pango_ot_ruleset_maybe_add_feature()
	pango_ot_ruleset_maybe_add_features()
	pango_ot_ruleset_description_hash()
	pango_ot_ruleset_description_equal()
	pango_ot_ruleset_description_copy()
	pango_ot_ruleset_description_free()
	pango_ot_tag_from_script()
	pango_ot_tag_to_script()
	pango_ot_tag_from_language()
	pango_ot_tag_to_language()

- Bugs fixed in this release:

	Bug 64538 – pango_layout_set_justify() doesn't work
	Bug 325714 – Pango should respect $LANGUAGE
	Bug 414264 – Pango vertical writing support is different with real
		     CJK usage.
	Bug 416515 – Time is not aligned with date on vertical panel
	Bug 429397 – Updated MS Mincho/Gothic are not listed in font dialog
		     properly on Vista/
	Bug 433805 – [Atsui] Approximate char/digit width width often 0
		     (worked around)
	Bug 434160 - [atsui] Italic versions of some faces can't be created
	Bug 435709 – pango_cairo_context_[sg]et_shape_renderer()
	Bug 355789 – Pango misaligns word-wrapped text due to trailing
		     whitespace
	Bug 436154 – Error building the pango.modules file while cross
		     compiling
	Bug 436988 – Adding PangoScript to PangoAnalysis
	Bug 437534 – pango_language_includes_script is buggy

Overview of changes between 1.16.3 and 1.16.4
==============================================

	Bug 419262 - Don't create coverage every time it's asked for

Overview of changes between 1.16.0 and 1.16.1
==============================================
- Improved Win32 backend: The Win32 backend has been
  updated to always require Uniscribe at compile-time (it still
  is optional at run-time), and to use the wide-character variants
  of Windows APIs which improves the backend in many ways.  The
  1.16.0 release is obsolete as far as the Win32 backend is
  concerned, and official DLLs were not built for it.
- Misc build system fixes
- Bugs fixed in this release:
	Bug 110521 – can't find bold and/or italic fonts on win32
	Bug 120195 – there are some functions in pangowin32-fontmap.c that
		might maybe should be static
	Bug 407315 – Use wide character Win32 API in the pangowin32 code
	Bug 412654 – SED variable undefined in the `libtool --config' output
		used by configure
	Bug 414297 – Fails to build with --enable-static
		--with-included-modules in thai lang module
		Patch from Loïc Minier

Overview of changes between 1.15.6 and 1.16.0
==============================================
- Improved docs, with an object hierarchy and cross references to glib and
  cairo docs now (may require rebuilding the docs to correctly detect glib
  and cairo prefixes).

==============================================
- Fix possible crasher in win32 font selection [Owen Taylor]
- Misc build fixes.
- Bugs fixed in this release:
	Bug 399738 – pango 1.15.5 won't compile on Mac OS X: 'FC_HINT_STYLE'
		undeclared (first use in this function)
	Bug 404295 – Crash initializing pango-win32 fontmap

Overview of changes between 1.15.4 and 1.15.5
==============================================
- Fix the "menu accels are two chars wide" bug that was introduced in 1.15.4
- Respect FC_HINT_STYLE in the ft2 backend.  Patch has been in Fedora for ages.
- Require automake 1.9
Bugs fixed in this release:
	Bug 398238 – pangorc file missing from tests directory

Overview of changes between 1.15.3 and 1.15.4
==============================================
General:
- Finish vertical text support.
- Fix various bugs that could cause ellipsization to stop prematurely.
- Fix rendering of background color being off in presence of rise attribute.
- Improved text-on-path example (examples/cairotwisted.c)

Win32 Improvements:
- Don't check for X and don't warn about missing fontconfig. [Tor Lillqvist]
- Automatically use -mms-bitfields on Windows when building with gcc. [Tor]
- Update makefile.msv. [Hans Breuer]

Code base cleanups:
- Whitespace cleanups.  Hopefully patches still apply using patch -l
- Replace C++-style // comments with C-style /* */ ones.
- Move the pango-view tool from examples/ into pango-view/.  The examples/
  dir is still available and for simple examples only.

Public API changes:

- New PangoLayout query functions:

	pango_layout_is_wrapped()
	pango_layout_is_ellipsized()
	pango_layout_get_unknown_glyphs_count()

  The is_wrapped and is_ellipsized functions return whether the layout
  had to wrap/ellipsize any paragraphs, as opposed to the get_wrap and
  get_ellipsize that return the wrap/ellipsize mode set.

- Misc new function:
	pango_parse_enum()

  This is more a convenience function for internal use, but set public
  to go with other pango_parse_* functions.  Bindings should feel free
  to ignore this.


- New header files:

  Moved gravity and matrix stuff into their own header files pango-gravity.h
  and pango-matrix.h.  Both are included from pango-types.h.

- Vertical text:

  New attribute types:

	PANGO_ATTR_GRAVITY
	PANGO_ATTR_GRAVITY_HINT.

  New enum type:

	PangoGravityHint

  New macro:

	PANGO_GRAVITY_IS_VERTICAL()

  New public functions:

	pango_attr_gravity_new()
	pango_attr_gravity_hint_new()
	pango_gravity_hint_get_type
	pango_context_set_gravity_hint()
	pango_context_get_gravity_hint()
	pango_gravity_get_for_matrix()
	pango_gravity_get_for_script()

  Removed:
	pango_matrix_to_gravity()

  replaced by pango_gravity_get_for_matrix()
  
  Gravity API added in previous releases:

	PangoGravity
        pango_gravity_get_type
        pango_context_get_base_gravity
        pango_context_get_gravity
        pango_context_set_base_gravity
	pango_font_description_get_gravity
	pango_font_description_set_gravity
	pango_gravity_to_rotation

  A tip on using the vertical text support: If you just want to get correct
  behavior in rotated labels (say, vertical Chinese/Japanese, but rotated
  Latin, etc), all you need to do is to set the context gravity to
  PANGO_GRAVITY_AUTO.  You can do this for example

	#if defined(PANGO_VERSION_CHECK) && PANGO_VERSION_CHECK(1,15,4)
	  pango_context_set_gravity (context, PANGO_GRAVITY_AUTO);
	#endif

Bugs fixed in this release:
	Bug 395328 – Map kATSDeletedGlyphcode to PANGO_GLYPH_EMPTY
	Bug 397337 – Use is_ellipsized and is_wrapped to optimize property
		     changes
	Bug 328585 – Need to know if a layout has unknown glyphs
		     Patch from LingNing Zhang
	Bug 326693 – PangoLayouts should be query-able about their
		     effective properties (width / wrapped / ellipsized / etc)
	Bug 397327 – pango-layout.c: 'pango_layout_is_ellipsized' must return
		     a value
	Bug 323173 – Add layout of mixed direction text for vertical layout
	Bug 394453 – Use -mms-bitfields
	Bug 392628 – Don't check for X on win32


Overview of changes between 1.15.2 and 1.15.3
==============================================
- Fix Hangul crasher and other Hangul bugs introduced in 1.15.2
- Spell-checked docs
- Build fixes
- Don't introduce bitfields in public structs.  This changes some public API
  that was broken in the 1.15 series.  The new struct is backward compatible
  with the older Pango series, but not with earlier 1.15.x devel releases.

- New Public API:

  * PangoAnalysis.flags and PANGO_ANALYSIS_FLAGS_CENTERED_BASELINE.  These are
    mostly only useful for the vertical text support in Pango, but language
    bindings probably want to update their bindings for PangoAnalysis to
    include these.

  * New PangoMatrix methods:

	pango_matrix_transform_distance()
	pango_matrix_transform_point()
	pango_matrix_transform_rectangle()
	pango_matrix_transform_pixel_rectangle()

    The transform_rectangle methods are particularly useful when an
    app/toolkit wants to know the extents of a rotated layout in device
    coordinates.  It will be used by Gtk+ for example, and is used by the
    pango-view tool too.  The _pixel_ variant takes a PangoRectangle in device
    units instead of Pango units.

  * Unit conversion helpers:

	pango_units_from_double()
	pango_units_to_double()
	pango_extents_to_pixels()

    The first two just convert between Pango units (fixed precision) and
    double floating-point numbers.  The current implementations are as simple
    as "(int)floor (d * PANGO_SCALE + 0.5)" and "(double)i / PANGO_SCALE", but
    the idea is to have optimized versions of these that do not use the FPU in
    the future.  That will be appreciated by embedded devices without FPU
    units.  Since the functionality can be generally useful, the API is made
    public.

    The pango_extents_to_pixels() function in conjunction with
    pango_matrix_transform_rectangle() makes it possible to convert extents to
    device space and round then, instead of having to transform rounded
    user-space extents.

- Bugs fixed in this release:
	Bug 351496 – PangoAnalysis::gravity breaks binary compatibility
	Bug 388702 – Crash when there's no Hangul glyph in the font.
	Bug 384543 – FcFontMatch misuse
	Bug 392789 – vpath build fails in basic module
		     Patch from J. Ali Harlow
	Bug 390877 – Don't feed pango-features.h to glib-mkenums
		     Patch from Yevgen Muntyan


Overview of changes between 1.15.1 and 1.15.2
==============================================
* Engines:
  - Improved Hangul shaper engine
  - Improved Indic shaper and language engines
  - Require libthai >= 0.1.7 for the Thai language engine

* Optimizations:
  - Avoid some floating-point operations.  Should cut the number of float
    ops per expose event in pangocairo to a half.
  - Cache ink and logical extents for PangoLayout

* New Public API:

  - New, generated, public header file pango-features.h.  Included by
    pango.h.  Currently contains the version information.  In the future,
    can be expanded to define which backends have been enabled, etc.

  - Public macros and functions for compile- and run-time version checking:

	PANGO_VERSION_ENCODE()
	PANGO_VERSION_MAJOR
	PANGO_VERSION_MINOR
	PANGO_VERSION_MICRO
	PANGO_VERSION
	PANGO_VERSION_STRING
	PANGO_VERSION_CHECK()
	pango_version()
	pango_version_string()
	pango_version_check()

    The scheme chosen here is a mixture of approaches taken by glib and cairo.
    The advantage over the glib model is that there are no public variables,
    but it still gives access to a string and numerical representation of the
    version number at compile- and run-time.
    
    The macros enable conditional compilation of code depending on newer Pango
    APIs, while the runtime functions allow refusing to run against old
    versions of the library.

  - New, readonly, version of methods that give read/write access to the
    internals of PangoLayout:

	pango_layout_get_line_readonly()
	pango_layout_get_lines_readonly()
	pango_layout_iter_get_line_readonly()
	pango_layout_iter_get_run_readonly()

    These should be used when you do not intend to modify the run/line,
    which is most of the time the case.  The only exception known to me
    is Firefox that adjusts glyph widths to do justification.  Most other
    uses that do not write to the returned structs (or structs accessible from
    them) should be ported to the new readonly API to benefit from major
    optimizations (in this case, line extents caching).  The list includes,
    but is not limited to, Gtk+, SWT, ClassPath, gnome-applets, libgnomeprint,
    xmlroff, GtkMathView, Conglomerate, Dia, Anjuta, wxWindows, The Gimp, 
    and various other applications/libraries:

      http://www.google.com/codesearch?hl=en&q=+pango_layout_(iter_)%3Fget_(lines%3F%7Crun)%5B%5E_%5D&start=50&sa=N

    Worth noting here is that, many uses of pango_layout_get_lines() can be
    replaced by a pango_layout_get_iter() that works both more elegantly and
    more efficiently.  The versioning macros introduced in this release can be
    used to make code use these new symbols without breaking compilation
    against older Pango (though, such code compiled with the new Pango cannot
    be run against an older Pango).

  - pango_language_get_default(): Note that, this does not make Pango
    fallback to the default language automatically (yet), but the user can
    use this function to set the default language of the locale on a context:

	  pango_context_set_language (context, pango_language_get_default());

    This essentially deprecates gtk_get_default_language().  The pango-view
    tool has been updated to use this feature, so it now respects $LANG when
    choosing fonts.

  - pango_color_to_string().

* Bugs fixed in this release:
	Bug 326099 – Setting width, indentation and ellipsizing doesn't work
		     as I would expect
	Bug 385478 – Fix tests on OPD platform
	Bug 319808 – Patch to let pango support artifical italic, bold and
		     bold italic styles for the fonts which don't have these styles.
		     Patch from James Su
	Bug 385321 – Worst case expansion for Sinhala
		     Patch from Harshula
	Red Hat Bug 211574: [hi/ml/si_LK] cursor naviation is wrong when
		     using ZWJ (200d)

		     Patch from Matthew Barnes
	Red Hat Bug 216850: Issue in combination with vowels (ml_IN)
		     Patch from LingNing Zhang
	Bug 382437 – tests/testboundaries fails
	Bug 333982 – Fallback to $LANG whenever NULL PangoLanguage is used
		     Patch from LingNing Zhang

Overview of changes between 1.15.0 and 1.15.1
==============================================
* Add Thai langauage engine. (currently makes tests/testboundary fail.)
* Add Lao and improved Thai sample text.
* Improved Indic module.
* Output correct path for hexboxes in pango_cairo_layout_path().
* Implement get_resolution method for the FT2 fontmap.  Shouldn't make
  any difference whatsoever.  Open a bug if it does.
* Misc small fixes.

* Optimizations:
  - Rework PangoLayout algorithms to avoid calling a recursive call to
    pango_layout_get_extents().  Avoids one pango_font_get_glyph_extents()
    call per glyph per layout rendering.  We now make 2 such calls.
  - Don't cache run_logical_rect in PangoLayoutIter.
    Avoids one pango_font_get_glyph_extents() call per glyph per layout
    rendering.  We are down to 1 now.
  - Cache line extents.  This avoids the final pango_font_get_glyph_extents()
    call per glyph per layout rendering.  Now we don't make any
    pango_font_get_glyph_extents() calls when rendering a layout (some
    conditions apply)!
  - Replace PANGO_IS_RENDERER with PANGO_IS_RENDERER_FAST for most
    internal uses, that is, just a NULL-check.
  - Use simple, fast, casts instead of PANGO_CAIRO_*() macros where the
    object cannot have reached us if it wasn't of the right type.

* Bugs fixed in this release:
	Bug 135683 – Cache glyphstring extents
	Red Hat Bug 211964: [ta] Rendering issue with Tamil

  font. (This will allow multiple modules to handle a script for
  different types fonts.)

  improve language tags. This solves problems with incorrect language
  tags resulting in drastically wrong fonts being selected by
  fontconfig.
